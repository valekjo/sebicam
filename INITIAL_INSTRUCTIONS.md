Implement a web application that is running a web server, available through local network (over wi-fi).

The application will be used to stream video and audio from a phone to the web server, and another phone/laptop will be able to connect to the stream.

It's intended use is as a safe baby monitor.

It should work in a following way:

 - Phone A streams video to the Server
 - Server allows Phone B to connect via browser
 - To be able to access the stream, Phone B must have a password generated by Phone A - it's possible to scan it as a QR code.
 - The server does not see inside the stream (it's encoded using the password/QR code only known to both phones)


## Tech requirements

Use node, npm, typescript, express, and vanilla js for frontend.
